# sie-eng270-project-soil-assesment
# Evolution of soil compaction and water content under intensive agriculture
## Project Description
Describe the purpose of the program.
the purpose of the program is to modelise the evolution of to parameters of a soil (water content and bulk density, which is related to compaction) under agrcicultural work. It plots modelised water content and bulk density over time and compares it to the same observed parameters, and checks its own realism by doing so.

## Input files
Describe the input files used by the program. (Located in "data/".)

The program takes initialisation data from a 20 year observation study for:
- Precipitation
- Temperature
- Porosity
- to complete

## Output files
Describe the output files generated by the program. (To be generated in "results/".)
- plot
- dunno

## Report
Templates for .tex and .odt formats are provided in "docs/". The formatting can be changed, but the sections should remain the same. The final report should be placed in "docs/" as "report.pdf".

## Running the program
Dependencies
Describe the operating system, programs (MATLAB/Python/C), version numbers, and external packages that need to be installed to run the program. Canonically, it should run on the SIE Linux VDI, but if you require a different configuration (e.g., more updated MATLAB version) you can state it here.

## Build
Describe how the C program should be compiled (using gcc or mex). The executable or shared object file can be placed in the "bin/" directory.

## Execute
Describe how the program should be executed. Ideally, it will be automated to one line of code in a terminal running Bash (e.g., matlab -batch src/myscript), with the outputs generated to "results/".

## Contributors
List the authors of the code.
